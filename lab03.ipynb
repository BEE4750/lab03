        "> @variable(m, lb <= x <= ub) # if you do not have upper or lower bounds, you can drop those accordingly\n",

        "> ```\n",
        ">\n",
        "> You can also set up multiple constraints using arrays of coefficients\n",
        "> and/or bounds. For example:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> ``` julia\n",
        "> I = 1:3\n",
